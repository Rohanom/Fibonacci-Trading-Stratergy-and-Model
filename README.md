This repository showcases a unique blend of **technical analysis** and **machine learning** to simulate and trade using **Fibonacci retracement levels**. Developed during my internship at **Pipraisers**, this project includes a comprehensive **presentation** on Fibonacci strategies and a Python-based ML model to generate actionable trading signals based on retracement zones.

## 🧠 Project Overview

📌 **Objective:**  
To build a machine learning-assisted system that analyzes price action, detects Fibonacci retracement levels, and suggests potential buy/sell trades based on those levels.

📌 **Components:**
- 🎯 A presentation introducing Fibonacci theory and real-world trading use cases
- 🤖 A notebook that simulates retracement levels using historical price data and applies a trained model for prediction
- 📈 Visualizations of entry/exit zones and model-driven trading logic

---

## 📽️ Presentation Overview

- 📊 What is Fibonacci Retracement?
- 🔢 Key Ratios (0.236, 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 0.786)
- 📉 Identifying swing highs and lows
- 📌 Drawing retracement levels in trending markets
- 📈 Entry & Exit techniques at Fib zones
- 🚫 Common mistakes in Fib trading
- 🧠 Real TradingView examples for visual reference

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model (Notebook)

- 📥 **Data Collection:** Historical price data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance)
- 📐 **Retracement Simulation:** Calculate Fib levels using high/low pivots
- 🔍 **Feature Engineering:** Create features like price deviation from Fib levels, volatility, trend confirmation
- 🧠 **Model Training:** Random Forest Classifier (or Logistic Regression) to predict retracement-based entry points
- 📊 **Results:** Backtested predictions and plotted decision zones
